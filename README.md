Fitting poisson regression to a dataset

## Outline
The poisson distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution is a discrete probability distribution often used to describe count-based data, like how many snowflakes fall in a day.
If we have count data 𝑦 that are influenced by a covariate or feature 𝑥, we can use the maximum likelihood principle to develop a regression model relating 𝑥 to 𝑦.
